## Airline Safety Dashboard

This was a course-long project that had several tasks (milestones) surrounding airplane safety. The topic was provided by the instructor, but the data and the research were on the student's to research. The end goal wasn't so much to get the "right" data, but to effectively tell a story with the data we were able to gather. Within each task folder contains: the code provided on how the data were gathered, parsed, cleaned, the Tableau workbook that met the task requirements, and brief descriptions of the dashboard.  

### Task 1 
The first task was to create a dashboard for internal team members to study. 

### Task 2


### Task 3
All items are related to the blog post about the safety of flying. 
The Tableau dashboard contains some old and some new items from previous presentations.
All data sources are cited at the bottom of the blog post.
